MusicNet-Early
==============
This is an early version of the MusicNet Project. 

The database is currently being ~~direly needs to be~~ optimized ~~as queries take 2+ minutes to return~~, ~~We are currently in the process of fixing and moving our database~~, so there is not a lot in the way of functional code,
other than stylization. 


The code and styles are subject to change and are not currently final.
