MusicNet-Early
==============
This is an early version of the MusicNet Project. 

The database direly needs to be optimized as queries take 2+ minutes to return, ~~We are currently in the process of fixing and moving our database~~, so there is not a lot in the way of function code,
other than stylization. 


The code and styles are subject to change and are not currently final.

<h1>UPDATES:</h1>
4/5: 
<ul>
<li>Sign up page fields now correctly reflect database field; Page is complete.</li>
<li>adduser.php added to handle data from Sign up page for inserting to DB; highly incomplete</li>
<li>Login will correctly pass data to auth.php and will query database for user information</li>
<li>Username is stored as session variable for easy access in the user's profile page(s)</li>
<li>Profile page has been expanded and now all pages of the sidebar have been represented</li>
</ul>
